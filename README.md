The executable JAR is included as well as the full source code directly from my Eclipse project.

All icons are included in the JAR, an Excel file is attached which makes updating the icons quick and easy.
Just drop the new files into the src/icons folder and export a new JAR or run from Eclipse.

To update data, the appropriate CSV file must be found in the src/csv folder.
The CSV files include headers but the general idea is to give the CD of every ability dependent on points entered.
